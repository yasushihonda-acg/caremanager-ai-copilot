# 07_phase2_review.md - Phase 2 Review Record

## Review Overview
*   **Date:** 2025-11-16
*   **Reviewer:** Veteran Care Manager "Sato-san" (Persona)
*   **Scope:** Updated Assessment UI (Tabbed Interface, 23 Items Coverage)

## 1. Feedback Summary
### Positive
*   **Structure:** "Dividing into tabs (Health, Living, Mental, Social) makes much more sense. It feels like the actual flow of a home visit."
*   **Coverage:** "Finally, I can record 'Shopping' and 'Money Management' separately. This is crucial for determining the need for helper services vs. family support."
*   **Touch Friendly:** "The buttons are still easy to press. I don't have to type everything."

### Negative / Issues
*   **Overview:** "Since it's split into tabs, I can't see the 'Whole Picture' at a glance anymore. Before printing, I want a summary screen."
*   **Data Entry:** "Some items like 'Past History' are too complex for just 4 buttons. I need to type specific disease names."

## 2. Next Steps (Phase 3 Planning)
*   **Input Refinement:** Add "Other (Free text)" options to the QuickButtons for items like Disease Name.
*   **Summary View:** Create a "Print Preview" or "Summary" mode that lists all entered data in one long scrollable page for final check.
*   **Logic Integration:** Connect the selected 'Basic Info' (e.g., Dementia) to the 'Appropriate Care Management Method' logic to suggest goals.
